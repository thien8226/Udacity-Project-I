Conclusion:
In this analysis, we tried to understand what influences the reservation prices with the help of AirBnB data for Boston. Of course, the results may be different for each city, but the current approach still can be used for other cities' data. The main takeaways of the Boston data analysis include:
Basic characteristics of the place (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, beds and accommodates) affect the reservation price.
The reservation price varies depending on the time of the year. For example, the busiest time to visit Boston is summer.
The host policies (minimum night, cancellation and phone number requirement) might also affect the reservation price. 
Therefore, if you were to visit Boston try to book in summer when it is less crowded and be certain of your trip as there may not be a cancel option for lower price listing. So now that we know how to choose between places offered by AirBnB and save money, it is time to travel and test it in practice!
